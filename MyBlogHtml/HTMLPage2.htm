                    My name is chitra kakkar and I come from a vast country like India- spanning 3.29 million sq.km and has 1.252 billion population. 
                    The tradition, culture and religions diverge broadly in this country. 
                    We have 780 different languages and more than 8 religions exist today. 
                    With all these positive specifications, my country also has abundant downside where social prejudice towards girls is one of them and are extremely rampant. The disparity between men and women are extremely deplorable. 
                    Girls are considered burden before they come to this world and become quarry of female feticides.<br /> 
                    If by chance they come to this world, they become victim of strong patriarchal traditions like illiteracy, dowry and child’s marriage. 
                    This is just a trailer of how girls are discriminated in my country, the whole film isn’t over yet. With every region and religion, discrimination takes several dreadful incarnations.  
                    <br />
                    I wonder why can’t people cognize the fact that we suffer for a reason which is not under anybody’s control.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am discussing all these particularity about the beliefs in my country because I was raised in a joint family where boys were preferred to girls and all privileges were only for boys which includes education. 
                    I was deprived of better education because my extended family didn’t want to spend money twice on me, first educating me and then arranging for dowry for my marriage. 
                    They couldn’t comprehend the fact that education is a nonpareil way to annihilate the social edictions like dowry and male-chauvinism.

        The main reason I am here because I want my readers to realize the importance of women’s education. 
        I want to fight for a cause which is called gender prejudice. I hope this blog becomes the profound avenue to promote this radical requisite for women. They also have the need of education like men do so that they get respect and sense of equality in the society. 
        Women lay the foundation in a kid’s life and is the strongest pillar in the family who have extensive amount of work to do in family than men. 
        They are the first teacher for her kids and they should know how to nurture and educate their kids. 
        A well educated women can give better environment to her child for the development and for better education. 
        As it is perfectly said by Dr. James Emmanuel Kwegyir Aggrey, “if you educate a man, you educate an individual but when you educate a woman, you educate a family”. 
        Educated women can support their family financially and can obliterate the social bigotry like dowry, illiteracy and unemployment. Education truly gives a meaning to their life and a perfect tool to design their own identity in the society to be treated equally.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why can’t we treat women equally as Women, just like men, have body, soul and many dreams?
        She is just another unique creation of god.  
        <br />
        <br />
        There are few inevitable things in life which makes it meaningful, and I believe education is one of them. 
        As correctly said by Nelson Mandela, “It is a powerful weapon which can change the world”. 
        It truly can change and enrich the world in every respect. Education opens up mind and nurture your independence. 
        Today my intention is promote the awareness of not only education in general but also women’s education. 
        I strongly feel that educating a woman is equally important and essential as educating men. 
        I have experienced in life that being a girl how education can get you the respect and freedom in life.
