# web_Project1_Portfolio
This is my Software development Portfolio for my Project1 for Web class.

##Portfolio for Software Development
This website is divided into six sections:-
* Home-A caoption with a banner image
* An about section,
* Skills section
* Git-Hub projects section
* testimonial section(Hard-coded)
* contact information 

##Tools used
* I have used Bootstrap and CSS to layout the design for the Single-page website. 
* It's 90 % responsive for the reason that some sections needed to be display on the entire deskhtop page. 
* I have used Javsscript and Jquery for some evnets that are happening on the webpage.

## Bugs
* I don't have any bugs for now but I know some sections on my webpage are not responsive which I know how to fix. It will be fixed real soon.

## Version-2
* I want to inlcude some more functinalities and some animations to make it look more intriguing.
