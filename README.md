# web_Project1_Portfolio
This is my Software development Portfolio for my Project1 for Web class.

##Portfolio for Software Development
This website is divided into six sections:-
* Home-A caption with a banner image
* An about section,
* Skills section
* Git-Hub projects section
* testimonial section(Hard-coded)
* contact information 

##Tools used
* I have used Bootstrap and CSS to layout the design for the Single-page website. 
* It's 90 % responsive for the reason that some sections(about) needed to be display on the entire deskhtop page. 
* I have used Javsscript and Jquery for some evnets that are happening on the webpage.
* It has a google translate option which can traslate the page into a desired langauage.
* I have used A contact-form inside a modal to let user type some message for me to contact.

## Bugs
* No bugs known..if you find any, please let me know :)

## Version-2
* I want to inlcude functionality for my contact form so that it submits the request to the server.
