# web_Project1_Portfolio

##Portfolio for Software Development
This website is basically has all the information about my Introdcution, skills, projects and my contact information for prospective employers.

##Tools used
I have used Bootstrap and CSS to layout the design for the webpage. It's 90 % responsive for the reason that some sections needed to be display on the entire deskhtop page. I have used Javsscript and Jquery for some evnets that are happening on the webpage.

## Bugs
I don't have any bugs for now but I know some sections on my webpage are not responsive which I know how to fix. It will be fixed real soon.

## Version-2
I want to inlcude some more functinalities and some animations to make it look more intriguing.
